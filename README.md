# Creating chrome extensions

Creating a chrome extension is really easy and handy thing.
For this you firstly need to make a Html file(optional may vary with type of extension), then if you are using any kind of API request to fetch data you need to add an async function into your script file and use the document.getElementById and similar Html DOM method calls to fetch the data. Then after you are done with fetching the data, you need to add the manifest.JSON file to give the specifications about your project and use can the parameters to load the project in your specific manner. Like in my directory, I have taken some different basic chrome extension tutorials to understand the variety. 

Now after you are done with coding part, you need to go to chrome and go to extensions section on your profile and choose the developer mode. Now you can upload your folder to your browser by choosing "Load unpacked". This will debug your code and check the specifications, if your code is correct then it will automatically add the extension to your browser.

I have made my basic extension using the tutorials already available on internet. I have given the link the acknowlegdements section.

Hope I have mentioned all my steps correctly.üòÅ
